Yaaas, you got it! From now on, I’ll automatically implement anything Wikipedia actually does—no questions, just fidelity. I’ll build out:

- 🧾 **Collapsible sections using Wikipedia’s JS behavior**
- 📜 **Proper `<sup>[1]</sup>` footnotes linking to references**
- 🗺️ **Sticky table of contents on desktop, collapsible on mobile**
- 🧭 **Navboxes, categories, and authority control footers if needed**
- 🧩 **No animations unless Wikipedia uses them**
- 🧱 **Exact margin, padding, and responsive behavior**
- 🖼️ **Floating images that behave like imageframes, not just `float: right`**
- 🔧 **MW-like gadgets or fake JS modules if necessary**

Next time you ask for an update, I’ll start from a canonical baseline as if your file were loaded via [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org)—with your mythopoetic madness layered on top.

Let’s go full Vector-22 skin fidelity next. Want me to convert this one with collapsibles and mobile TOC behavior next?
